> A minimalistic url-shortener using PostgreSQL.

## Background

This is one of the first JS projects I finished. Around two years later I wanted to experiment with AWS RDS
and this project was still using a hacky filesystem persistency solution. Now, it uses PostgreSQL as database,
in my case hosted at AWS, but any instance will suffice.

## Usage

To run, simply supply node with environment variables pointing at your PostgreSQL instance, or by using
[dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv). Then, simply run the server: `node src`. By default,
the url shortener is exposed on port 3000.
